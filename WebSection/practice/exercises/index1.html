        <p>Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island city-state <br>
            in maritime Southeast Asia. It lies about one degree of latitude <br>
            (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of <br>
            the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Straits of Malacca to the west, the Riau <br>
            Islands (Indonesia) to the south, and the South China Sea to the east. The country<br>
            's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, <br>
            and one outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the<br>
            country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has <br>
            the third greatest population density in the world. With a multicultural population<br>
            and recognising the need to respect cultural identities, Singapore has four<br>
            official languages; English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua<br>
            franca. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape<br>
            national policies in education, housing, and politics.</p><br>
